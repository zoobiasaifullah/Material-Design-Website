## 🎯 What Is This Project?

You'll transform a Swiss design website into a completely different design style using **pure AI collaboration**—no manual coding required.

### The Twist: AI Writes About Your Partnership

At the end, the AI will create a "collaboration story" page where it reflects on how you worked together. This becomes your unique portfolio narrative.

### What Makes This Different

- **No code writing** — You guide, review, and refine through conversation
- **Design taste development** — Learn to recognize good design vs. generic
- **AI as your eyes** — AI can't see; you provide screenshots and feedback
- **Real portfolio piece** — Professional quality site in one week
- **Honest process** — Document struggles, not just successes

## 💬 How Vibe Coding Works

**Traditional Coding:**
```
You write code → Test it → Debug it → Repeat
```

**Vibe Coding:**
```
You describe vision → AI codes → You screenshot → Review together → Refine → Repeat
```

### The Core Principle: AI Is Blind 👁️

AI cannot see what it built. **You are its eyes.**

This means:
- Take screenshots constantly (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- Describe what you see ("the heading feels too small")
- Share screenshots with every review
- Guide AI to refine based on visual feedback

### You're Developing Design Taste

Your job isn't to code—it's to:
- ✅ Know when something feels right or wrong
- ✅ Recognize authentic style vs. generic templates
- ✅ Catch when AI goes off track (and stop it)
- ✅ Iterate 2-3 times per section until it's great
- ✅ Make bold design choices (not safe ones)

---

## 📅 Your 5-Phase Journey

### Phase 1: Research & Vision (6 hours)
- Choose your design style
- Find 10-15 authoritative examples (museums, books, not Pinterest)
- Generate initial AI mockup

### Phase 2: Context Building (4 hours)
- AI extracts best practices from reference site
- Define your design system (colors, typography, spacing)
- Setup quality gates (AI does this automatically)

### Phase 3: Sprint Planning (2 hours)
- AI creates detailed sprint plan
- Break work into 4-6 manageable chunks
- Setup project repository

### Phase 4: Build & Iterate (22 hours)
- Work through sprints one at a time
- **Review each section 2-3 times minimum**
- Take screenshots, share feedback, refine
- AI codes, you guide and judge

### Phase 5: Reflection & Polish (6 hours)
- AI writes collaboration story (breaking 4th wall)
- Final quality checks (Lighthouse, accessibility)
- Deploy and submit

**Total: ~40 hours across one week**

## 🎬 Quick Start (5 Minutes)

**Right now, do these 3 things:**

1. **Open QUICK-START-CHECKLIST.md** and read Day 1
2. **Look at the style table** above and pick 2-3 that interest you
3. **Open ONE-WEEK-PROJECT-GUIDE.md** and read "Phase 1" (10 minutes)

**Then stop and start your research phase.**

Don't try to read everything at once. Use documents as references when you need them.

---

## ⚡ Key Success Factors

### Do This:
✅ Take screenshots constantly (desktop, tablet, mobile)  
✅ Review each section 2-3 times before moving on  
✅ Track your time (shows how fast AI collaboration works)  
✅ Stop AI when it goes off track (press ESC in VS Code)  
✅ Ask "why" to understand AI's decisions  
✅ Push the style further (first version is always too safe)  
✅ Be honest in collaboration story (include struggles)

### Avoid This:
❌ Accepting AI's first draft without iteration  
❌ Skipping mobile testing  
❌ Forgetting to take screenshots for reviews  
❌ Trying to read all documents at once  
❌ Playing it safe (make bold design choices)  
❌ Letting AI work without your guidance  
❌ Writing code manually (this defeats the purpose)

## 🎯 Your Portfolio Narrative

This isn't just a class project. You're creating a unique portfolio piece that demonstrates:

- **Strategic AI Collaboration** — You know how to work with AI effectively
- **Design Judgment** — You can recognize and create good design
- **Rapid Prototyping** — You built professional quality in one week
- **Honest Documentation** — You can reflect on process, not just results

The collaboration story makes your project memorable. Everyone else says "here's my website." You say "here's my website, and here's an honest reflection from the AI about how we built it together."

**That's portfolio gold.** 🏆

---

## 💡 Questions?

**"Do I really write zero code?"**  
Yes. Pure vibe coding. You talk, AI codes. You're developing design taste and collaboration skills.

**"What if I'm not a designer?"**  
That's the point. You'll develop design judgment through iteration. The AI has design knowledge—you provide vision and feedback.

**"What if AI goes in the wrong direction?"**  
Stop it! Press ESC in VS Code. Undo with CMD+Z. Tell AI what's wrong and guide it back on track.

**"How do I know when a section is 'done'?"**  
Use DESIGN-QUALITY-CHECKLIST.md. Review 2-3 times minimum. When it passes all criteria and feels right, it's done.

**"Can I see an example?"**  
Keith's Swiss design site is your reference for technical structure. Style guides show visual examples for each design style.

---

## 🚀 Ready to Begin?

## 🎓 Learning Objectives

* Understand the **Swiss design lineage** as a system of rules, not just aesthetics.
* Learn to **collaborate with AI agents** in a structured, auditable workflow.
* Practice **refactoring, design system extraction, and documentation.**
* Demonstrate how **form and content align** — the website teaches what it embodies.
* Apply **linting, validation, and responsive design** to enforce technical discipline.

---

## 🧩 Concept

Every student’s website is a **self-explanatory design artifact**:
It *looks like* its style and *explains* its style.

Your task is to turn design theory into an executable system.
When a visitor lands on your page, they should both **see** and **understand** that design tradition.

## 🔄 Workflow

### 1. Clone the Baseline Repository

Begin with the provided repo implementing the **Swiss Style** site.
Use it as your **source of design logic**, not just code.

### 2. Use AI as a Research Partner

Open VS Code’s agent and run analytical prompts. Examples:

```text
Perform a technical debt audit.
```

→ Identify redundant utilities, accessibility gaps, and code duplication.

```text
Perform a design review to align the site with the Material Design standard.
```

→ Generate a list of specific layout and hierarchy adjustments required.

```text
Extract all design tokens and typographic scales into a style.md document.
```

→ Produce a baseline spec for your new style system.

Your role is to **direct, question, and validate** the AI — not to accept everything it generates.

### 3. Define the Style System

Using the AI and your research, produce:

* `style.md` – a brief history and design philosophy.
* `style-tokens.json` – color palette, type scale, spacing, motion, and layout variables.

Iterate using prompts like:

> “Refine the typographic scale to match Humanist Modernism and explain your rationale.”

### 4. Refactor the Site Section by Section

Work iteratively — don’t let the AI overwrite the whole project.
Ask it to refactor specific regions:

* Hero and Navigation
* Article Grid / Card Layout
* Footer / System Map
* Typography and Responsive Rules

Example prompt:

> “Apply Nordic Minimalism principles to the hero section while maintaining responsive behavior.”

After each refactor, **review the diff** and ensure it aligns with your design intent.

### 5. Validate and Document

* Run **linting** and **Lighthouse** tests after each stage.
* Log your prompts and decisions in a `decision-log.md`.
* Capture **before/after screenshots**.
* Commit frequently with meaningful messages.

### 6. Prepare for Gallery Submission

Each project must include:

* A complete, responsive 11ty page.
* `style.md`, `style-tokens.json`, and `decision-log.md`.
* Annotated screenshots explaining your design decisions.
* A brief paragraph of copy for the gallery index describing your style.

Keith Williams will curate the strongest submissions into the
**Swiss Lineage Gallery**, which will be shared publicly and featured on LinkedIn.

---

## 📖 Content Requirements

Your site must **teach the viewer** about your chosen style.

### Narrative Structure

1. **Origin** – historical and cultural context.
2. **Design Logic** – the rules, grid, and visual grammar.
3. **Legacy** – what it influenced or how it rebelled.

### Integration of Form and Content

* The site’s layout, typography, and rhythm should **embody** the principles described in the text.
* Each section should **demonstrate what it explains**.
* Avoid generic lorem ipsum — write concise, informative copy with AI assistance, then revise it for clarity and accuracy.

---

## 🤖 AI Collaboration Protocol

**Your AI agent is your studio assistant.**
It doesn’t replace your judgment; it amplifies it.

### Do:

* Provide **context**: show code blocks, screenshots, and goals.
* Use **specific, analytical prompts**:

  * “Find spacing inconsistencies in this layout.”
  * “Compare this component to Bauhaus geometry principles.”
* **Iterate**: refine the prompt until the output matches your intent.
* **Reflect**: document what worked and what failed.

### Don’t:

* Ask vague questions like “Make it better.”
* Accept full rewrites without inspection.
* Use AI to generate the entire site from scratch.

Your skill will be judged by the **quality of your collaboration**, not the AI’s raw output.

## 🧠 Evaluation Criteria

| Dimension               | Description                                         |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **AI Collaboration**    | Clarity of prompts, refinement, and reflection      |
| **Design Authenticity** | Fidelity to the assigned style’s principles         |
| **Technical Quality**   | Clean code, linting compliance, responsive behavior |
| **Narrative Clarity**   | Content that effectively teaches the design style   |
| **Aesthetic Craft**     | Visual coherence, typographic balance, and polish   |

---

## 🗣️ Final Exhibition

The **Swiss Lineage Gallery** will function as an online museum of design systems — a living demonstration of how AI collaboration can both preserve and evolve visual culture.

Outstanding works will be:

* Featured publicly with credit
* Used as teaching exemplars in future courses
* Shared with Keith Williams’ professional network and on LinkedIn

### 💬 Closing Note

This project isn’t about decoration — it’s about **translation**.
You’re learning to read, interpret, and re-express design logic across generations of media.
The AI is your collaborator in that journey, not your replacement.

Design the future with discipline, curiosity, and accountability.
